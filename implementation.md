# Tank Alien Shooter Game - Implementation Plan

This document outlines a step-by-step approach to implementing the Tank Alien Shooter Game, broken down into small, logical steps. Each phase builds upon the previous one, allowing for testing and verification at each stage.

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Environment

### Step 1: Initialize Project
1. Set up a new project with Vite
2. Install Three.js and necessary dependencies
3. Create basic folder structure (src, assets, components)
4. Set up development environment with hot-reloading

### Step 2: Create Basic Scene
1. Initialize Three.js scene, camera, and renderer
2. Set up a simple lighting system
3. Create a basic ground plane
4. Implement the game loop (requestAnimationFrame)
5. Test rendering capabilities

### Step 3: Basic Input System
1. Add event listeners for mouse movement
2. Implement mouse position tracking
3. Add event listeners for mouse clicks
4. Test input detection with console logs

## Phase 2: Core Game Elements

### Step 4: Player Tank Implementation
1. Create a simple 3D model for the tank
2. Position the tank at the bottom of the screen
3. Implement left-right movement based on mouse position
4. Add bounds checking to prevent the tank from moving off-screen
5. Test tank movement and controls

### Step 5: Implement Bullet System
1. Create a simple 3D model for bullets
2. Implement bullet firing mechanism on mouse click
3. Add bullet movement logic (straight line upward)
4. Implement bullet lifecycle management (creation and destruction)
5. Test firing and bullet movement

### Step 6: Implement Basic Alien
1. Create a simple 3D model for aliens
2. Implement basic spawn mechanism at the top of the screen
3. Add simple downward movement for aliens
4. Test alien spawning and movement

## Phase 3: Game Mechanics

### Step 7: Collision Detection
1. Implement bounding box or sphere collision detection
2. Add collision detection between bullets and aliens
3. Add collision detection between tank and aliens
4. Test collision detection with visual feedback

### Step 8: Scoring System
1. Create a score variable and display
2. Increment score when aliens are destroyed
3. Implement score display in the UI
4. Test scoring mechanism

### Step 9: Game State Management
1. Implement game states (start, playing, game over)
2. Create start screen
3. Implement game over condition when tank is hit
4. Create game over screen with restart option
5. Test game flow from start to end

## Phase 4: Enhanced Gameplay

### Step 10: Different Alien Types
1. Create multiple alien models with different appearances
2. Implement varying movement patterns (zig-zag, diagonal)
3. Add different point values for different alien types
4. Test alien variety and behavior

### Step 11: Object Pooling
1. Implement object pooling for bullets to improve performance
2. Implement object pooling for aliens
3. Test performance with many objects

### Step 12: Difficulty Progression
1. Implement a wave system for aliens
2. Add increasing difficulty (speed, spawn rate) over time
3. Test difficulty curve and balance

## Phase 5: Audiovisual Enhancement

### Step 13: Sound Effects
1. Add sound effects for shooting
2. Add sound effects for alien destruction
3. Add game over sound
4. Implement background ambient sound
5. Test audio system

### Step 14: Visual Effects
1. Add particle effects for explosions
2. Implement simple animations for aliens
3. Add visual feedback for hits
4. Test visual effects

### Step 15: UI Improvements
1. Create a polished UI for score display
2. Add health/lives indicator
3. Implement pause functionality
4. Add game instructions
5. Test UI usability

## Phase 6: Polish and Optimization

### Step 16: Performance Optimization
1. Profile game performance
2. Optimize rendering pipeline
3. Implement level-of-detail for distant objects
4. Test on different devices/browsers

### Step 17: Game Balance
1. Adjust difficulty curve
2. Balance scoring system
3. Fine-tune control responsiveness
4. Playtest and gather feedback

### Step 18: Final Polish
1. Add final visual touches
2. Fix any remaining bugs
3. Optimize loading times
4. Conduct comprehensive testing
5. Prepare for deployment

## Phase 7: Deployment and Post-Launch

### Step 19: Deployment
1. Build production version
2. Set up hosting
3. Deploy the game
4. Test deployed version

### Step 20: Post-Launch Support
1. Monitor for issues
2. Gather user feedback
3. Plan future enhancements based on feedback

## Implementation Approach

For each step:
1. Implement the specific feature in isolation
2. Test thoroughly before moving to the next step
3. Refactor code as needed for maintainability
4. Document any design decisions or technical challenges
5. Commit changes to version control with descriptive messages

This iterative approach ensures that each component works correctly before building upon it, making debugging easier and allowing for regular progress tracking.
